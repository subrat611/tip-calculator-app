## Overview

My weekly project from frontend mentor is a simple tip calculator app to test basic react js skills (state, effects, etc.).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

<!-- ## My process -->

### Built with

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop First workflow

<!-- ### What I learned -->
